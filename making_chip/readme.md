## Step 1: Requirement Specification
We’ll define high-level functional and performance requirements for a 32-bit ARM-based SoC, including components like memory, peripherals, and interfaces.

## Step 2: Architecture Specification
We’ll describe the SoC architecture, including:

- Processor: ARM Cortex-M or Cortex-R core.
- Peripherals: UART, GPIO, Timers, SPI.
- Interrupt Controller: Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).
- Memory Map: On-chip SRAM, peripherals, and external flash/DDR.
- IOMUX: To configure pin functionality.
- Fuses: For security and configuration.

## Step 3: IP-XACT Generation
*The IP-XACT will define:*

- Components: Processor, peripherals, buses.
- Bus Interfaces: AMBA AXI or AHB/APB interfaces.
- Memory Map: Address ranges for SRAM, peripherals, and external memory.
- Registers and Fields: Details for all registers, including offsets and field descriptions.
- Interrupts: Mapping interrupt sources to NVIC.
- IOMUX: Configurable pin multiplexing details.
- Fuses: Security configuration registers.


## Step 4: Reference Manual and Header Files
A detailed document describing:

- The SoC architecture.
- Registers and fields (description, offsets, bitfields).
- Peripheral operation (e.g., UART configuration, GPIO toggling).

C header files to define register access macros and constants.

## Step 5: Register Specification and Verification

- RAL Model: A UVM-based Register Abstraction Layer (RAL) model for verification.
- C Test Cases: Basic tests to validate register behavior (e.g., read/write access, interrupts).
- Simulation Setup: Create a simulation environment to verify register interactions.

## Step 6: RTL and Test Benches
- RTL Code: Verilog/VHDL implementation of the SoC components.
- Testbenches: Create testbenches for:
- Processor core.
- Peripherals (e.g., UART, GPIO).
- IOMUX and fuses.
